# Predicting_Stock_Prices

## Explore the data with some EDA
First, let's explore the data. Any time we begin a machine learning (ML) project, we need to first do some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to familiarize ourselves with the data. This includes things like:

raw data plots
histograms
and moreâ€¦
I typically begin with raw data plots and histograms. This allows us to understand our data's distributions. If it's a normal distribution, we can use things like parametric statistics.

There are two stocks loaded for you into pandas DataFrames: lng_df and spy_df (LNG and SPY). Take a look at them with .head(). We'll use the closing prices and eventually volume as inputs to ML algorithms.

Note: We'll call plt.clf() each time we want to make a new plot, or f = plt.figure().

## Correlations
Correlations are nice to check out before building machine learning models, because we can see which features correlate to the target most strongly. Pearson's correlation coefficient is often used, which only detects linear relationships. It's commonly assumed our data is normally distributed, which we can "eyeball" from histograms. Highly correlated variables have a Pearson correlation coefficient near 1 (positively correlated) or -1 (negatively correlated). A value near 0 means the two variables are not linearly correlated.

If we use the same time periods for previous price changes and future price changes, we can see if the stock price is mean-reverting (bounces around) or trend-following (goes up if it has been going up recently).

## Create moving average and RSI features
We want to add historical data to our machine learning models to make better predictions, but adding lots of historical time steps is tricky. Instead, we can condense information from previous points into a single timestep with indicators.

A moving average is one of the simplest indicators - it's the average of previous data points. This is the function talib.SMA() from the TAlib library.

Another common technical indicator is the relative strength index (RSI). This is defined by:

RSI = 100 - 100/1+RS
RS = average gain over n periods/average loss over n periods

The n periods is set in talib.RSI() as the timeperiod argument.

A common period for RSI is 14, so we'll use that as one setting in our calculations.

## Create features and targets
We almost have features and targets that are machine-learning ready -- we have features from current price changes (5d_close_pct) and indicators (moving averages and RSI), and we created targets of future price changes (5d_close_future_pct). Now we need to break these up into separate numpy arrays so we can feed them into machine learning algorithms.

Our indicators also cause us to have missing values at the beginning of the DataFrame due to the calculations. We could backfill this data, fill it with a single value, or drop the rows. Dropping the rows is a good choice, so our machine learning algorithms aren't confused by any sort of backfilled or 0-filled data. Pandas has a .dropna() function which we will use to drop any rows with missing values.

## Check the correlations
Before we fit our first machine learning model, let's look at the correlations between features and targets. Ideally we want large (near 1 or -1) correlations between features and targets. Examining correlations can help us tweak features to maximize correlation (for example, altering the timeperiod argument in the talib functions). It can also help us remove features that aren't correlated to the target.

To easily plot a correlation matrix, we can use seaborn's heatmap() function. This takes a correlation matrix as the first argument, and has many other options. Check out the annot option -- this will help us turn on annotations.
